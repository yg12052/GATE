    <p class="subtle"><em>To the one who has found this book:</em></p>

    <p>Know that you were not led here by chance.</p>

    <p>If your eyes now trace these lines,<br>
      then you have been chosen for a purpose few have carried since the dawn of magic.</p>

    <p>Four gates exist within this world —<br>
      and their power is such that their very existence was hidden from history, from record,<br>
      and from the memory of mortals and sorcerers alike.</p>

    <p>I am the last who knew their resting places.<br>
      And so I concealed them —<br>
      lest they fall into the hands of those whose hearts bend toward ruin and hunger for dominion.</p>

    <p>Understand this:</p>

    <p>The path before you is neither simple nor safe.<br>
      Yet if you have reached this page, it means that within you dwells a spirit capable of bearing the burden of the Four Elements:</p>

    <p><strong>Air.</strong><br>
      <strong>Water.</strong><br>
      <strong>Earth.</strong><br>
      <strong>Fire.</strong></p>

    <p>Each gate is bound not only by riddle,<br>
      but by the nature of the element it guards.<br>
      You will not pass by intellect alone.<br>
      You must listen.<br>
      Observe.<br>
      Adapt.</p>

    <p>In the moment you are ready to know more,<br>
      the book shall reveal another page.</p>

    <p>You cannot force it forward.<br>
      You cannot hold it back.</p>

    <p>It will move in accordance with your progress.</p>

    <p class="final">And when the final seal trembles —<br>
      you will understand why this knowledge was buried.</p>

    <p class="final">Proceed with care.<br>
      The elements remember.</p>
